	<li>Combined data - In order to ensure data accuracy and offer personalized services, content, marketing and ads, we may link or combine the information that we collect from the different sources outlined above. For example, we may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by our Automatic Data Collection Tools (see <a href="#cookies-and-website-automatic-data-collection">Cookies and Website Automatic Data Collection</a>) to derive your general geographic area. Information may also be linked via a unique identifier such as a cookie or account number.</li>

<h2>Third Parties With Whom We Share Your Data</h2>
<h3>Sharing with Elastic Affiliated Entities</h3>
<p>We may transfer your Personal Data to other Elastic entities within the US or worldwide for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement. To ensure that your Personal Data is private, Elastic entities are contractually bound to comply with our privacy requirements. For the transfer of Personal Data to Elastic entities outside of the European Union, we have agreed on respective EU Model Clauses between the Elastic entities. Furthermore, our privacy guidelines are communicated to our employees on an annual basis as part of our mandatory security and privacy awareness training. By accessing our websites, registering a product or for services, creating an account, or otherwise providing us with your Personal Data, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data throughout the global Elastic network of entities on the basis of the international restrictions stated above.
</p>
<h3>Sharing Data with Third Party Service Providers</h3>
<p>We will not provide your Personal Data to third party advertisers without your permission, except as provided in this privacy statement. We will not share Personal Data with third parties that would directly contact you without your explicit consent to be contacted by a partner. However, we may provide information and data that is not Personal Data, to our third party providers for any purpose including primarily customizing and targeting advertising messages.
</p>
<p>We work with external service providers to plan, manage and/or support certain aspects of our business operations on our behalf.
</p>
<p>These service providers may be located in the US or in other global locations and may provide services such as credit card processing, customer support, advertising and marketing activities (including digital and personalized advertising), email service, or data hosting. Our service providers are required by contract to safeguard any Personal Data they receive from us and are prohibited from using the Personal Data for any purpose other than to perform the services as instructed by Elastic.
</p>
<p>Examples of our third party service providers and the use of your data:
</p>
<ul class="list-black">
	<li>Google Analytics - We use Google Analytics to understand visitor trends, page popularity, geographic distribution of interest, time on pages, or issues with our site. We use this data to understand how to invest in regions based on demand. For more information about Google Analytics, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a> and for more information about how Google uses data when you use a Google partner's sites or apps, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a></li>
	<li>Clearbit - In an effort to reduce the amount of information we require users to enter when registering for content or trials on our Site, we use Clearbit to enrich information. For example, many forms only ask for an email address. We securely pass the email address to Clearbit to provide us additional information that may include social identification (like Twitter handle), first and last name as well as organizational affiliation.</li>
	<li>Kickfire - Used to identify organizations (not individuals) visiting our site. We leverage this information to determine regional investments in our support, website, sales, and marketing investments.</li>
	<li>Facebook - We service a growing community of over 75,000 global followers on Facebook and use the platform to inform this community of new content available. We use a Facebook cookie to match audiences and enable us to ensure we can deliver paid (and unpaid) advertising to our Facebook Elastic followers and additional audiences that we think would be interested in the content.</li>
	<li>Google AdWords - We use Adwords to deliver advertising through Google's network of advertising sites.</li>
	<li>LinkedIn - We serve a community of over 30,000 global followers on LinkedIn. We share content with this community, and use matching techniques to provide advertising on LinkedIn. The matching techniques include the use of a cookie we execute on our websites and may include email matching (which is only used for Elastic advertising).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing Data with Third Parties Who May Collect Information</h3>
<p>The following third parties may collect information through the Site, but, except as set forth above, such information shall not include Personal Data unless you post or publish such Personal Data in areas of the Site accessible to other users or the public:
</p>
<ul class="list-black">
	<li>third parties that help facilitate the Site may, from time to time, collect information through the Site in the course of providing support;</li>
	<li>we may share Site information with partners for marketing purposes;</li>
	<li>third parties may collect other information that you voluntarily post or publish through the Site in any way; and/or</li>
	<li>web-crawlers such as Google or Yahoo may collect information through the Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Site may contain links or references to other websites, including third party advertisers and other unaffiliated websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of those websites or of advertisers on the Site, and you should read the privacy policies of each website you visit.
</p>
<h3>Sharing Financial Information</h3>
<p>Elastic uses third party payment processors to process payments made to us. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processors. These third party processors currently include Wirecard. Chase Paymentech, and Recurly, and their privacy policies may be viewed at:
</p>
<ul class="list-black">
	<li>Wirecard: <a href="http://www.wirecard.com/privacy-protection/">http://www.wirecard.com/privacy-protection/</a>;</li>
	<li>Chase Paymentech: <a href="http://www.chasepaymentech.com/privacypolicy/">http://www.chasepaymentech.com/privacypolicy/</a>;</li>
	<li>Recurly: <a href="https://recurly.com/security">https://recurly.com/security</a> and <a href="https://recurly.com/legal/privacy">https://recurly.com/legal/privacy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing Data for Other Reasons</h3>
<h4>Corporate transactions</h4>
<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Elastic decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its businesses. In such transactions, we may disclose or transfer your Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers, or receive your Personal Data from sellers. Our practice is to seek appropriate protection for your Personal Data in these types of transactions.
</p>
<h4>Compliance with law</h4>
<p>We may also share your Personal Data when we believe, in good faith, that we have an obligation to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of law enforcement agencies, regulators, courts, and other public authorities, including to meet national security or other law enforcement requirements; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other criminal or malicious activity; (iv) enforce/protect the rights and properties of Elastic and/or our affiliates; or (v) protect the rights or personal safety of Elastic's and our affiliates' employees, and third parties on or using Elastic property when allowed and in line with the requirements of applicable law.
</p>
<h3>Online Advertising and Tracking</h3>
<p>Elastic engages with third-party advertising networks on the Site. Ad networks may include third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. After you visit our websites, these ad networks may continue to track your online activities over time across third-party websites or online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, identifiers, web server logs, web beacons and other methods.
</p>
<p>Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track ("DNT") mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.
</p>
<h3>How We Keep Your Data Secure</h3>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, and to ensure the appropriate use of your information, we utilize reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect and process. We retain the data only as required or permitted by law, and while the data continues to have a legitimate business purpose.

<h2>Cookies and Website Automatic Data Collection</h2>
<p>We use and allow certain other companies to use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies (collectively "Automatic Data Collection Tools") on our website and in the marketing, sale and delivery of our products and services. We do this to understand your use of our website and our products and services and to improve your user experience and to enable personalized features and content, optimize our advertisements and marketing, and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the internet.

</p>
<h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are stored on your device when you visit a site. The entity that places cookies on your browser can then read the information on that cookie that it set. We categorize cookies as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Necessary cookies</strong> - These cookies are essential for our websites and their features to work properly, and for us to properly provide services that depend on our websites and these features. (e.g., to remember cookie permission settings, session logins, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>Convenience cookies</strong> - These enable us to improve the usability and performance of our websites and services that depend on our websites. (e.g., to remember selection of region and country to redirect visitors to localized websites, or for altering or suggesting content that matches navigation patterns.)</li>
	<li><strong>Statistics cookies</strong> - Used to collect information about how you navigate to and from our websites and how you use our website. The collection of this information is carried out as anonymous access measurements. Statistics cookies may be classified as either session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies expire when you close your browser session. Persistent cookies may remain on your system for an extended period of time.</li>
	<li><strong>Targeting/Retargeting cookies</strong> - Used by our advertising services to provide you with Elastic-relevant advertising content.</li>
	<a name="third-party-advertising-cookies-and-social-media-cookies">&nbsp;</a>
	<h3>Third Party Advertising Cookies and Social Media Cookies</h3>
	<p>We use third party cookies on our websites, which will then be stored on your device (unless you opt-out) to allow them to show you advertisements that may be relevant and useful to you. We may use remarketing tags (e.g., Facebook, Outbrain, Google, LinkedIn) that align with these third party cookies to deliver advertisements about products that you have browsed on our site when you are on third party websites. However, the remarketing tags that we use do not include any information that directly identifies you. We would note, however, that these advertisers and other third parties (including ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may correlate the remarketing tag to their own third party cookies, and infer the user ID of users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content.
	</p>
	<p>Cookies may also be used when you share information using a social media feature on our website or with services made available via our website. The social media network may record your activities which may be linked to targeted advertising. The types of cookies used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies' privacy policies.

	<h2>Other Automatic Data Collection Tools</h2>
	<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
	<p>We may use and permit select third parties to use web beacons (usually in combination with cookies) to compile information about your website usage and your interaction with email or other communications, to measure performance and to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
	</p>
	<p>A web beacon (also known as a web bug or clear GIFs) is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that can be embedded in online content, pictures, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the date and time when you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. For instance, we may include web beacons on our websites, and in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether our messages have been opened or acted upon and whether our mailing tools are working correctly.
	</p>
	<p>Because web beacons are the same as any other content request initiated in a web page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, you may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in messages you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other Automatic Data Collection Tools in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. For more information, refer to the details provided by your email software or service provider. Web beacons may also be rendered ineffective in some circumstances by opting out of cookies or amending your cookie settings in your browser.
	</p>
	<h3>Embedded Web Links</h3>
	<p>Emails from us often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the web, after redirection through our servers. The redirection system allows us to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our communications and marketing initiatives. In emails, such web links may also allow us to determine whether you have clicked a link in an email, and information about this interaction may be connected to your personal identity.
	</p>
	<p>If you do not want us to collect information about the links that you click, you can:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-black">
		<li>Change your choice about how you receive communications from us (i.e., choose a text-based version of the message where available) or choose not to click links in emails that we send.</li>
		<li>Choose privacy settings in your browser and email client that will restrict this information.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Your Rights</h2>
	<p>At your request, we will: (i) inform you of what personal information we have on file for you; (ii) amend or correct the personal information that we have on file for you or any previous privacy preferences that you have selected; and/or (iii) erase personal information that you have provided to us, or that we have collected. You may do so by contacting us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@elastic.co">privacy@elastic.co</a>; provided, however, that we ask individuals to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or erased before processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).
	</p>
	<p>For information regarding advertising opt-out and cookie choices, please see <a href="#third-party-advertising-cookies-and-social-media-cookies">Third Party Advertising Cookies and Social Media Cookies</a> above.
	</p>
	<p>If you ask us to erase your Personal Data from our records, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to do so while retaining any record necessary to comply with a governmental authority or applicable federal, state, or local law.
