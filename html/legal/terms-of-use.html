	If you send or transmit any communications, comments, questions, suggestions, or related materials to Elasticsearch, whether by letter, email, telephone, or otherwise (collectively, "Feedback"), suggesting or recommending changes to the Site, Site Content or any services offered through the Site, including, without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, all such Feedback is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary.  You hereby grant to Elasticsearch a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, irrevocable, perpetual license, including the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to use or incorporate into the Site and/or any products or services  any and all Feedback.  For the avoidance of doubt, Elasticsearch shall be free to use, without any attribution or compensation to you, any ideas, know-how, concepts, techniques, or other intellectual property and proprietary rights contained in the Feedback, whether or not patentable, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, importing, having imported, licensing, marketing, distributing, reproducing, and selling, directly or indirectly, products and services using such Feedback, and otherwise exploiting in any manner such Feedback.  You understand and agree that Elasticsearch is not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or techniques contained in the Feedback, and you have no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.

<h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
	This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA). All suits hereunder will be brought solely in Federal Court for the Northern District of California, or if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any California State Court located in Santa Clara County.  The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or defense.

<p>
	Elasticsearch prefers to advise you if we feel you are not complying with these Terms and to recommend any necessary corrective action.
